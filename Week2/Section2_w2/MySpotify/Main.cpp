/*Test your program up until here. Create a main.cpp file and implement the main method. In here, create a couple playlists with a couple songs and add them to a PlaylistContainer instance. 
Then, get those same playlists using the getter from the instance and display the playlists in the console. 

What happens when you try to get a playlist with an out of bounds index? How would you handle it?
When you make sure everything is working, you can continue to the next exercise.*/
